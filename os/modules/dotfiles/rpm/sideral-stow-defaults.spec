# Re-apply after `rpm-ostree upgrade` with `ujust apply-defaults` to

%description
Ships sideral's default dotfile seed as GNU-stow packages:
  - /usr/share/sideral/stow/<pkg>/ — one subdir per concern
    (bash/, zsh/, ghostty/, mise/, zed/). Each holds the destination-
    shaped layout (e.g. ghostty/.config/ghostty/config) so
    `stow --target=$HOME --dir=/usr/share/sideral/stow <pkg>` symlinks
    cleanly into $HOME.
  - /etc/profile.d/sideral-stow-defaults.sh — sources on every login
    shell; runs stow over every package on first login (marker-guarded),
    then becomes an instant no-op.

To re-apply after `rpm-ostree upgrade` (e.g. when a new package was
added to the seed), run `ujust apply-defaults`. To customize a single
file, replace its symlink with a real file before editing — stow will
refuse to overwrite a regular file on next apply.

%changelog
* Mon May 11 2026 GitHub Actions <noreply@github.com> - 0.0.0-2
- Add `zed` stow package: ships ~/.config/zed/settings.json with
  vim_mode enabled and Helix-style default_mode (selection-first, then
  verb). Pairs with the helix/code → zed editor swap in sideral-cli-
  tools 0.0.0-13. /etc/profile.d/sideral-stow-defaults.sh auto-
  discovers the new package directory — no script change needed.
* Sun May 10 2026 GitHub Actions <noreply@github.com> - 0.0.0-1
- Initial. Replaces sideral-chezmoi-defaults: chezmoi swapped for GNU
  stow as the image-default dotfile seeding tool. Source tree
  reorganized from chezmoi format (dot_bashrc, dot_config/...) to
  per-package stow layout (bash/.bashrc, ghostty/.config/ghostty/...).
  /etc/profile.d/sideral-stow-defaults.sh runs `stow --restow
  --no-folding` over every package on first login. nushell support
  dropped alongside the swap.
